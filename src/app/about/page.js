          Hi there! I'm a creative and tech-savvy individual based in New
          Orleans, passionate about art, anime, gaming, and all things design.
          My goal is to merge creativity and technology to create meaningful and
          engaging experiences. With a background in legal administration and a
          love for learning, I'm transitioning into the tech space to bring
          innovative ideas to life.
